Simple Hydrogen demonstarting server components and streaming server side rendering with suspense.

Hydrogen is a React framework and SDK that you can use to build fast and dynamic Shopify custom storefronts.

[Check out the docs](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/hydrogen)

This demo uses the [hello-world] starter template. You can checkout the base template on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/Shopify/hydrogen/tree/stackblitz/templates/hello-world-js).

## Getting started

This repo is organized with a series of tagged commits that allow you to walk through the demo as pieces of functionality are added.

**Requirements:**

- Node.js version 16.5.0 or higher
- Yarn

This repo uses the Hydrogen preview store but can be changed to a store of your choosing by updating `hydrogen.config.js` with your shop's domain and Storefront API token!
